// A server manages many clients and the clients can create groups and subscribe to the groups.
// There is a special client among all clients, used to create groups on the server.
// Other clients then subscribe to the groups of interest. 
// After subscribing, clients will start receiving messages from that group.
// These messages are send after a predefined time period as per the configurations made by the super client during group creation

Group Chat:
1. Start the server
3. Start the special client
4. The special client creates groups on the server
2. Start the client thread
5.Start the other clients

Through the classes in java.net, Java programs can use TCP or UDP to communicate over the Internet. The URL, URLConnection, Socket, and ServerSocket classes 
all use TCP to communicate over the network. 
The DatagramPacket, DatagramSocket, and MulticastSocket classes are for use with UDP.

We use UDP to let the clients receive packets basing on their
IP address and port number.

Example of something we want
 https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_networking.htm

Groups are created by creating a new connection at a diffrent port number.
messages are then sent to the group at that port number, thats the approach we shall use


we start a client
start the super client to show a list of groups to join
